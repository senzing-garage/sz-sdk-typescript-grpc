## [4.0.0-beta.2.0] - 2025-04-28

### Removed

- `SzGrpcConfig`: config now represents a senzing config and is no longer directly accessible through an environment. Creation and initialization of `SzGrpcConfig` should now be done through methods in `SzGrpcConfigManager` and by manipulating a working instance of a `SzGrpcConfig`
    - `CloseConfig`
    - `CreateConfig` moved to `SzGrpcConfigManager#createConfig`
    - `ExportConfig` moved to `SzGrpcConfig.definition`
    - `ImportConfig` moved to `SzGrpcConfig.definition`
- `SzGrpcConfigManager`
    - `AddConfig` removed in favor of `createConfig`.
    - `getConfig` config instance no longer directly tied to config manager instance.
- `SzGrpcEnvironment`
    - `config` no longer accessible through environment instance. To work with the current config you should use `SzGrpcConfigManager#createConfig(existing ConfigId Or Definition)` pattern instead. (see examples)
    - `getConfig` (see above)

### Added

- `SzGrpcConfig`:
    - `definition` getter/setter replaces `SzGrpcConfig#importConfig` and `SzGrpcConfig#exportConfig` methods.
    - `verifyConfig` verifies whether a config definition passed to it(or the one currently assigned to the config instance when not passed in) is a valid senzing configuration 
- `SzGrpcConfigManager`:
    - `createConfig` creates a new instance of `SzGrpcConfig` from a existing configId, config definition(JSON), or from the template associated with the environment.
    - `setDefaultConfig` Registers the specified config definition with an autogenerated comment(if none provided) and then sets the default configuration ID for the repository to the configuration ID that is the result of that registration, returning the config ID under which the configuration was registered.
    - `registerConfig` registers the configuration described by the specified configuration definition in the repository with the specified comment.
- `SzGrpcEngine`
    - `whySearch`

### Modified

`SzGrpcConfig`
- removed the `configId` parameter from:
    - `addDataSources`
    - `addDataSources`
    - `deleteDataSource`
    - `getDataSources`

Examples updated to reflect additions and changes
